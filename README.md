# Lixtal-Calculator-For-reading

LIX is an abbreviation for readability index. It is a scale that provides a measure of the readability of a text. It is calculated as the average number of words per. Health, plus the percentage of long words, ie. words that are over six letters long.
The greater the number of credits, the harder the text is to be. However, a low rate does not guarantee that the text is easily readable. The calculation takes no matter how the text is built (sentence constructions, reasoning), proportion of foreign words and the background of the reader.
